                    The next campaign will take place on the Aborghast a interstellar colony ship travelling between a future earth and a far off exo-solar system. This will be a cyber punk world turned on its head by space travel, and the abandonment of earth.The World you are leaving behind is one that was defined by a extremely rigid caste system, rampant corporate greed, and a dead earth. You will play a human that has grown up on earth and is part of the last colony ship leaving earth. You will be full of cybernetics (or not), most likely a criminal and ready to make your mark in the new world. But first you will have to get there. You have a thousand year journey ahead of you. While everything on the ship may be taken care of for you, the old ways die hard and everyone is looking to be on top of the pile. Will you hide away from all the dangers, or will you become the predators? The game it self will be using the rule system Cities Without Number and have modules from Stars Without Number. Both of those links lead to the official free rule books. The games combat will be quick and brutal. For example it is entirely possible for you a level one character to one shot a much higher level character, transversely it also makes you extremely fragile. At this point I have built out the world and have moved on to start building the maps and other assets for play. For that I request your help I need to get some art assets that work with the dungeondraft map building software. To this end I have created a Ko-fi page where you can donate some money. I have also created a new savings account that this is linked to create a true supply fund where all money donated will go directly to this and future campaigns.
