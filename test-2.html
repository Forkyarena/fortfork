You will be full of cybernetics (or not), most likely a criminal and ready to make your mark in the new world. But first you will have to get there. You have a thousand year journey ahead of you. While everything on the ship may be taken care of for you, the old ways die hard and everyone is looking to be on top of the pile. </p><p>The game itself will be using the rule system <a href="https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/449873/Cities-Without-Number-Free-Version" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Cities Without Number</a><a href="https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/449873/Cities-Without-Number-Free-Version" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"></a> and have modules from <a href="https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/230009/Stars-Without-Number-Revised-Edition-Free-Version" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Stars Without</a><a href="https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/230009/Stars-Without-Number-Revised-Edition-Free-Version" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> Number</a>.   Both of those links lead to the official free rule books. The games combat will be quick and brutal. For example it is entirely possible for you a level one character to one shot a much higher level character, transversely it also makes you extremely fragile. </p><p> </p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" style="outline: 3px solid rgba(var(--color-primary-rgb), 0.55) !important;" src="https://www.fortfork.com/media/posts/2/PDFXEdit_u7QdsEeKaW-2.png" alt="" width="403" height="743" sizes="(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)" srcset="https://www.fortfork.com/media/posts/2/responsive/PDFXEdit_u7QdsEeKaW-2-xs.png 300w, https://www.fortfork.com/media/posts/2/responsive/PDFXEdit_u7QdsEeKaW-2-sm.png 480w, https://www.fortfork.com/media/posts/2/responsive/PDFXEdit_u7QdsEeKaW-2-md.png 768w, https://www.fortfork.com/media/posts/2/responsive/PDFXEdit_u7QdsEeKaW-2-lg.png 1024w"></figure><p>At this point I have built out the world and have moved on to start building the maps and other assets for play. While up to this point I have payed for everything we use. Like the foundry key and the forge server hosting. So I am asking for your assistance in buying some art assets to be used in the dungeon draft software. For this I have set up a <a href="https://ko-fi.com/notfork" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Ko-fi</a> donation page and will accept Zelle also. In addition I have set up a separate savings account to help keep track of the funds and make sure they go towards this and future expenses.You should not feel in anyway obligated to donate but any help towards these costs will be greatly appreciated. </p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.fortfork.com/media/posts/2/9AJVZS6lPw.png" alt="" width="818" height="841" sizes="(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)" srcset="https://www.fortfork.com/media/posts/2/responsive/9AJVZS6lPw-xs.png 300w, https://www.fortfork.com/media/posts/2/responsive/9AJVZS6lPw-sm.png 480w, https://www.fortfork.com/media/posts/2/responsive/9AJVZS6lPw-md.png 768w, https://www.fortfork.com/media/posts/2/responsive/9AJVZS6lPw-lg.png 1024w"></figure></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on January 28, 2024</p><div class="post__share"></div></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__inner"><div class="footer__copyright"><p><a href="https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Theme</a> </p></div></div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://www.fortfork.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=74fad06980c30243d91d72c7c57fcdb8"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
